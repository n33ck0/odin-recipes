Hi! This is the first large project for TOP. It will be a simple recipe webpage!

Although I'm an Upper Junior @ CUNY's Queens College, I'm delving into HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to make myself more employable!

Looking forward to setup a pretty nice GitHub page to impress recruiters!

This will be a recipe for making pseudo-espresso coffee in a Moka-Pot
